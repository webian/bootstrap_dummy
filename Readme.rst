Bootstrap package for TYPO3 CMS
================================

Check it out the live example running at http://bootstrap.typo3cms.demo.typo3.org/. The package is provided in the demo area of typo3 meaning it is
possible to log in the BE and play around. The demo is reset every three hours as information.
Head to http://bootstrap.typo3cms.demo.typo3.org/typo3 and log-in with "admin" "password" as credentials.

Motivation
-------------

All started with the modernisation of our Dummy package we were using in our company. To give a bit of background, we were aiming to:

* Have Twitter Bootstrap as HTML / CSS Framework
* Use as much as possible Fluid for the rendering and the templating. Actually, it turned out we have reached the 100% thanks to the work of Claus Due
* Keep folder fileadmin clean from TS / JS / CSS files which should be for storing media only (images, documents etcâ€¦)

We wanted not only a package to demonstrate the capability of TYPO3 but also something useful so that it should save us from the tedious and repeating work when kick-starting a website. The result is pretty much promising. More important we **have put everything in public** so that you can test and also take advantage for your own needs.


How to install?
===============

There are two options, either you can get the **stable version** from http://get.typo3.org/bootstrap or you can follow this
little step by step tutorial to get the **master version** - in no time to talk the marketing guy :) Notice the
`system requirement`_ before proceeding and make sure PHP 5.3.7 - 5.4.x and MariaDB / MySQL 5.1.x-5.5.x is installed in your
system::

	# Clone the repository
	git clone --recursive git://github.com/Ecodev/bootstrap_package.git

	# Download TYPO3 CMS Core
	cd bootstrap_package/htdocs
	wget get.typo3.org/current -O typo3_src-latest.tgz

	# Extract TYPO3 CMS Core archive and symlink
	tar -xzf typo3_src-latest.tgz
	rm typo3_src-latest.tgz
	ln -s typo3_src-* typo3_src

	# Manual steps
	-> configure a Virtual Host. Convenience example for Apache:

		<VirtualHost *:80>
		    DocumentRoot "/var/vhosts/example.fab/htdocs"
		    ServerName example.fab
		    ServerAlias *.example.fab
		    ErrorLog "/var/vhosts/example.fab/logs/error_log"
		    CustomLog "/var/vhosts/example.fab/logs/access_log" common
		</VirtualHost>

	-> add a DNS entry (e.g editing /etc/hosts file)
	-> open in the browser http://example.com and run the 1,2,3 wizard


Notice the ``htdocs`` folder located at the root of the direction is not mandatory. It just matches our hosting convention in our company.
If you want to get rid of it, rename the file structure to your convenience when configuring the Virtual Host.

Support
==================

Bugs and wishes can be reported on the `bug tracker`_. You can also take advantage of some commercial support related to the Bootstrap Package by contacting contact@ecodev.ch.

How to continue?
==================

As a next step, you likely want to change the CSS, add some custom layouts or customize configuration.
The place to head to is ``EXT:speciality`` which is located at ``htdocs/typo3conf/ext/speciality``. The name "speciality"
is just the extension key we are using in our company as convention. We keep it across our projects so that we don't have to think more
where to find the source code. This is not a big deal to change the name in case. However, the extension is mandatory and contains:

* HTML templates - ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/``
* Public resources such as JavaScript and CSS files  - ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Public/``
* PHP Code - ``EXT:speciality/Classes/``

Adding a new layout
---------------------

As a short tutorial, let assume one needs to add a 4 column layout in the website. Proceed as follows:

* Copy ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/3Columns.html`` to ``EXT:speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/4Columns.html``
* Update section "Content" and "Configuration" in ``speciality/Resources/Private/Templates/Page/4Columns.html``

You have a new layout to be used in BE / FE! So quick? You don't believe me, do you?

As further reading, I recommend the `excellent work / documentation`_ from `@NamelessCoder`_ which framework is used in the Bootstrap package, sponsored by `Wildside`_  and its motivation. Also, I recommend having at look `fluidpages_bootstrap`_ which definitely contains more advance examples for page layouts.

What special features is here?
=====================================

Static TypoScript files API
----------------------------

Static configuration files are usually managed and stored in the database. To be precise they are added from a Template record (AKA ``sys_template``) in tab "Includes".
However, it would be nicer to handle in a programmatic way so they can be versioned in the source code. For that purpose a thin API is available taking advantage of hook in ``\TYPO3\CMS\Core\TypoScript\TemplateService``. In file ``ext_localconf.php``, you will find the following code::

	# A list of static configuration files to be loaded. Order has its importance of course.
	\TYPO3\CMS\Speciality\Hooks\TypoScriptTemplate::getInstance()->addStaticTemplates(array(
		'EXT:css_styled_content/static',
		'EXT:speciality/Configuration/TypoScript',
		'EXT:fluidcontent/Configuration/TypoScript',
		'EXT:fluidcontent_boostrap/Configuration/TypoScript',
	));

It is still possible to load a static configuration file from a Template record as usually. Notice, it will be loaded on the top of the ones added by the API. Thanks Xavier for your inspiring `blog post`_.

Override configuration in Context
---------------------------------------

@todo this section is obsolete and must rewritten after this patch has landed http://forge.typo3.org/issues/50131

While developing on its local machine, it might be interesting to override default values of the live website.
A good example, is the domain name for instance which will be different than the one in production.
It can be performed by adding configuration in directory ``EXT:speciality/Configuration/Development``.

* If present, two TypoScript files will be automatically loaded on the top (and will override the default configuration)

	``EXT:speciality/Configuration/Development/setup.txt``
	``EXT:speciality/Configuration/Development/constants.txt``

* A PHP file can be added ``EXT:speciality/Configuration/Development/DefaultConfiguration.php`` for PHP configuration which will also be automatically loaded. Just make sure, the extension "speciality" is loaded at last to avoid unwanted behaviour.

Tip for development
---------------------

* TYPO3 has many levels of caches. While it is good for performance, it will become very annoying in development mode. Check out the `uncache extension`_ to work around.
* For new TYPO3 developers which are starting with extension development take advantage of the `extension builder`_.

Behavior-driven development
==================================

According to Wikipedia, `behavior-driven development`_ (abbreviated BDD) is a software development process based on test-driven development.
The main purpose of BDD is to ensure the feature set is there taking the point of view of a User (largely speaking). It is also referred as
"Acceptance tests". Acceptance criteria should be written in terms of scenarios and implemented as classes:
Given [initial context], when [event occurs], then [ensure some outcomes].

Since an example is worth a thousand words::

	cd tests

	curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install

	./bin/behat

Feature tests files are to be found into ``tests/features``.

Making your own introduction package
=====================================

Building your own introduction package is much easier than it looks. Actually the ``EXT:introduction`` (which provided the boilerplate code) was designed to manage multiple packages.
You will need to fork the Introduction extension from https://github.com/Ecodev/introduction.git which was extracted from the `TYPO3 Git repository`_. (Don't know why there isn't a standalone repository for this extension?)

So here are the steps:

* Fork https://github.com/Ecodev/introduction.git
* Duplicate directory with your own name ``EXT:introduction/Resources/Private/Subpackages/Introduction``.
* Go through the files and replace what makes sense.
